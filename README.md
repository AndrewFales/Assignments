This is a collection of completed projects from various computer science and business information technology courses I have taken. Most are written in Java, however a few are written in C++.
Many of the projects were testing my ability to implement various datastructures or algorithms from stratch, such as a Minimum Heap(minheap), Binary Search Tree(bst), Hash Table, Sorting Algorithms.

There are a few that go more indepth than just general datastructure implementations. 

These include:

MusicBox:
  
  A project written in C++ to give the user general music playlist functionality, implemented using a linkedlist.

Playlist Recommender:
  
  A project written in C++ that is able to generate a recommended playlist's for each user based off their listening habits, as well as their friends listening habits.
  The generator is implemented using hashmaps, unordered sets, linkedlists, vectors and bubble sort.

Soil Drainage Matrix:

  A project written in Java that will take in soil data in the form of a n by n matrix of 1's and 0's to see if the soil will properly drain to the bottom.
  Functionality was achieved through an implementation of the union-find (disjoint set) algorithm to analyze the matrix.

Regex Webscraping:
 
  A project written in Java that is able to parse HTML from a stock website using regular expressions. The webscraper is implemented using maps, trees and regex.
