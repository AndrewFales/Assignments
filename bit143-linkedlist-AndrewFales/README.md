# Data Structures & Algorithms - LinkedList
![LinkedList](https://sarabostani-public.s3.amazonaws.com/ds-and-algo/img/Linkedlist.png)
## Overview
In this assignment we are going to implement a simple LinkedList class. The goal is to provide add, read, and delete operations.
## Notes
The instructions are intentionally minimal. As we progress in the course, the instructions become less descriptive and you should consider all corner cases before running the test.
Unit tests check for corner cases which is a good way of looking at the code and implementing it correctly.

As always, try to run or debug your code in the main method and make sure all functionalities are in place.
