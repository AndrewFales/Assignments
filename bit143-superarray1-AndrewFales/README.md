## Introduction
In this assignment we are going to create a data structure, called SuperArray, that works like an array but has more features. The basic operations of insertion, deletion, update, and search are supported by this data structure and internally it stores the data in an array of fixed size.
## Tasks
Read the comments in `SuperArray.java` and complete the tasks that are required. Upon successful completion, you should be able to call all methods successfully and test the results in `Main.java`.
